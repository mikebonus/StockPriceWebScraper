This is an application that displays a list of ACTIVE stocks being traded in <b> SNP500
(from <b>CNN Business</b>: https://money.cnn.com/data/hotstocks/sp1500/)

I created this application independently and the core functionality has been done
through web-scraping. 

10 Stock prices fluctuating in both <b>[Most Actives Table]</b> and <b>[Gainers Table]</b> from 
the above link get automatically displayed in this application (LIVE). 

This application is also capable of handling network connection, so if there is no wifi
connection, then the system will generate a toast message reminding users to find a
network connection to see the stock prices. 

This source code can be highly scaled up to the point where pretty much all the data that
we see in SNP500 or Dow jones or just about anything for that matter can be web-scraped
and displayed on any mobile device. [This is the purpose of this particular demo application]

Thank you for reading!
